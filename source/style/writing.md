# Writing Style

Every group has their rules to be clear and consistent. As with everything we do, ours focus on accessibility and clarity over what may be considered more "correct".

## Voice

What do we say?

## Tone

How do we say it?

## Style

How do we write it?

### Reading Level

Many people have cognitive impairments or other issues that can affect reading or reading comprehension. We aim for **an 8th grade reading level**, as it allows you to be clear and concise while remaining accessible to a wide audience.

### Numerals

Write all numbers numerically, no matter how small. But if it starts a sentence, spell it out. If a sentence starts with a number bigger than 999 reword until it dosen't begin the sentence.

Use a space every 3 digits for clarity on numbers over 9999, and use a decimal point (".") to delimit between whole and fractional. This section does not apply to versions.

If its a number written out, write out percent, otherwise, use the percent sign.

For numbers over 999,999 you may use abbreviations such as 1 million, but make sure it makes sense in the context. We prefer spelling them out unless you are short on space.

- DO:
    - Seventy-seven percent of statistics are made up on the spot.
    - Two cats fought over the bed.
    - More than 6% of the population is LGBTQIA+ of some sort.
    - The population of earth is over 8,000,000 people.
    - A gigabyte is over 1 trillion bytes.
- DON'T:
    - 77% of statics are made up on the spot.
    - 2 cats fought over the bed.
    - More than 6 percent of the population is LGBTIQ+ of some sort.
    - A gigabyte is 1 073 741 824
    - A gigabyte is 1,073,741,824
    - A gigabyte is 1.073.741.824

### Punctuation

Punctuation breaks text into readable chunks. They also help indicate how something is meant to be read!

Don't punctuate headlines of any sort with a period. Other punctuation is fine if used sparingly. If its a multi-sentence headline, reword until its one sentence or less.

- DO:
    - On difficulty options in games
    - Tales from beyond: the dragon of the east
    - Style Guide
    - Danger! in the mines
    - Problems with long headlines
- DON'T:
    - On difficulty options in games.
    - Style Guide.
    - Tales from beyond: the dragon of the east.
    - Danger in the mines.
    - There are many problems with long headlines. Here we go over a few of them.

#### Periods

Periods go where they belong in a sentence. In other words, if you are quoting a short quip it goes outside the quotation makes. If you are quoting something longer, it goes inside. You may have punctuation both in and outside quotes.

- DO:
    - "nya!" the girl said, pouncing on the bed.
    - The girl said "I like stuffies", I do too!
- DON'T:
    - "nya"! the girl said, pouncing on the bed.
    - The girl said "I like stuffies." I do too!

#### Dashes

There are three kinda of dashes. We mostly avoid them.

Avoid hyphenating words, either join them into one or leave a space between them, it tends to help readability. If it really is more readable to join them: do it.

- DO:
    - This is written by a manically insane person.
    - We don't use single letter variable names.
- DON'T:
    - This is written by a manically-insane person.
    - We don't use single-letter variable names.

En-dashes indicate a range, and should never have space to either side. Think of it as replacing "to" or "through".

- DO:
    - The party is between 13:00–15:00.
- DON'T:
    - The party is between 13:00 – 15:00.

Em-dashes join two sentences into one longer sentence. This hurts readability, so we avoid it. In cases where it is useful, it is much better to use a colon (":") or comma (",") to join sentences.
- DO:
    - We don't use single-letter variable names: it hurts readability.
- DON'T:
    - We don't use single-letter variable names — it hurts readability.

#### Colons

If a fragment follows a colon, don't capitalize. If a complete sentence does, do capitalize.

- DO:
    - We don't use single-letter variable names: it hurts readability.
    - Tonight: Watch the stuffies unite to take over the bed in ultimate fashion!
- DON'T:
    - We don't use single-letter variable names: It hurts readability.
    - Tonight: watch the stuffies unite to take over the bed in ultimate fashion!
    
#### Commas

Use the Oxford comma. It just helps.

- DO:
    - I like mango, banana, and peach.
- DON'T:
    - I like mango, banana and peach.

#### Ellipses

Ellipses can help add feeling into writing: but don't overuse them! Always add a space following an ellipse.

#### Semicolons

Semicolons are controversial. We mostly use them to separate two related definitions, and in more format documents.

- DO:
    - Black bear: a species of bear; genus Ursus.
    - (in formal context) If a *End User* fails to adhere to these terms we may: (a) terminate thier service, or; (b) request currency for damages.
- DON'T:
    -

#### Apostraphies

### Pronouns

We use gender-neutral language, unless we are referring to a specific person or character of known preference.

## Blocks

Don't indent paragraphs. Always leave a blank line between paragraphs.
