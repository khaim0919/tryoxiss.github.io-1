## Block Policy

My block policy is **extremely aggressive** to keep my feed clean. I deal with enough shit as it is, and I don't my fedi to make me deal with more. Common block reasons include:

-  *posting common trigers or repeatedly posting long notes without a content warning, or my triggers without a content warning* (not listing them here, I have too many bad actors trying to get a rise out of me, sorry. Feel free to dm for them).
- Federating with a large number of bad actors
- Having people who are witch hunting me and not taking action within ~16 hours of my report (I don't care if thats one bad apple, because that is one *really bad* apple), or having people who endorse people who are doing it.
- Being un/lowly moderated
- Anarcho Anything (`An*`). Its not a system that works, because it is not even a system. Its doomed to evolve into another system. Like "Anarcho Communism", do you even REALISE how insaine you sound? "Anarchy (no govenment or ruling bodies) Communism (Wealth distributed via a ruling body)".
- Overt consistant negativity. Some is fine, we all need a place to vent, but if you post nothing but depressing/negative things, then its a nope from me.

## Abbriviations / Terms

**TRIGGER WARNING** for *everything*, I don't go into any detail, but I do list the meaning of many trigger related abbriviations. You should be able to easily skip over them, though.

I use a variety of misc short codes and abbriviations when refering to things.

I may add the pos (+) or neg (-) modifiers, I tend to try and do them in the ratio they are in, so if something is like 2/3rds posative but a bit negative it may be like "thing ++-".

### Content Warnings

- **tw** = trigger warning
- **pw** = psych ward
- **mh** = mental health, (less commonly: mental hospital)
- **ph** = physical health
- **sh** = self harm
- **inp** = inpatient
- **sa** = sexual abuse
- **nsfl** = gore/messed up (not safe for life)
- **sui** = suicide / suicidal thoughts
- **ch** = childhood (as in, ch trauma)
- **mbd** (or simillar) = mental breakdown (could be literal, or a psychotic episode, etc)
- **oh** = overheard
- **ec** = eye contact (probably will never happen)
- **dp**, **dr** = depersonalisation, derealisation.

Most other things I spell out fully, these are the main abbriviations I use!

### Misc

- **crypto** = cryptography
- **agere** = age regression
- **glwt** = good luck with that
