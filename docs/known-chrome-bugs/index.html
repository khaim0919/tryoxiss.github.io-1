        <p>This is a list of bugs on our website that we know about. We will not fix any chrome specific bugs, ever. Here is why:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google Chrome is destroying the open web. There is no better way to put it. They use thier near-monoply to determine the future of the internet, which often means locoking people specifically to thier services, and thier vision of the internet.</p>
<p>I don't think it takes an expert to say that thier vision of the internet is not what most people want, or what would be best for the internet.</p>
<p>It's a world where privacy is something only your grandparents remember, a world without adblock, or freedom to do what you will with webpages. A world where only big tech is discoverable or known about.</p>
<p>This is why, in an effort to drive people to better, open source, fully capable browsers, like <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> we will never fix any chrome or chromium specific bugs on our website. And if that is the future you truly want, I don't know why you are reading the website of someone to highly advocates for openness, decentralisation, etc.</p>

<p>(The format is: <strong>Bug Name</strong> (known since DD/MMM/YYYY): details )</p>
