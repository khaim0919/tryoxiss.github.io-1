## Abbriviations / Terms

**TRIGGER WARNING** for *everything*, I don't go into any detail, but I do list the meaning of many trigger related abbriviations. You should be able to easily skip over them, though.

I use a variety of misc short codes and abbriviations when refering to things.

### Content Warnings

- **tw** = trigger warning
- **pw** = psych ward
- **mh** = mental health, (less commonly: mental hospital)
- **ph** = physical health
- **sh** = self harm
- **inp** = inpatient
- **sa** = sexual abuse
- **nsfl** = gore/messed up (not safe for life)
- **sui** = suicide / suicidal thoughts
- **ch** = childhood (as in, ch trauma)
- **mbd** (or simillar) = mental breakdown (could be literal, or a psychotic episode, etc)
- **oh** = overheard

Most other things I spell out fully, these are the main abbriviations I use!

### Misc

- **crypto** = cryptography
- **agere** = age regression
- **glwt** = good luck with that
