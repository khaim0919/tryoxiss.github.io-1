Methodology: 
Ideology: 

This code style was written explecitly with following languages, engines, and frameworks in mind. However, it should work for most languages and frameworks. 
- Python 3
- Rust Edition 2021
- Godot Engine with;
    - GDScript
    - Rust

## Naming

Naming is also covered in architecture, but here we provide do's and don't's with naming things. 

- **Clarity** is one of the most important things. Everything should be named in clear descriptions. 

### Explictly approved variable names

We recignise that sometimes it makes the most

## Architecture

### Compsition over Inheritance

### Explicit over Implicit

### Functions

- **Naming:** Functions are always named with `snake_case`. 
    - **Callback Functions** (functions that are not called manually, but instead by an engine or prefab) are to be prefixed with an `_`.
