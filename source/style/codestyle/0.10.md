title: Beautiful Codestyle
---

This code style is written keeping in mind some core concepts of what we believe "good code" looks like. This code style is written with Python, GDScript, Rust, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript (ew) in mind. It should, however, be applicable to almost any programming language. 

## Pillars

1. **B**reatheable - space between blocks, and spread out. 
2. **e**xplicit - Names should be clear, and types should be explictly set when possible and reasonable. 
3. **a**tomic - a function should be the smallest useable amount of code
4. **u**seful - the code should serve a purpose or solve a problem. Dead code should be removed and redundant code should be its own function (where reasonable)
5. main**t**ainable](#maintainable) - Code should be future-proof to the extent it can survive the expected lifespan of the project, and be clear for future maintainers. 
6. **i**ntentional - code should never be there "just because", it should always have a purpose. 
7. **f**lat] - nested code is harder to read and maintain, minimise nesting where possible and more than 5 layers is explictly banned (with exceptions).
8. **u**nanimous - All code should feel as though it was written as a whole and feel cohesive. That is the problem this code style adresses. 
9. **l**egible - code should be designed and written in such a way that it is easy to read.

Or all together: **Beautiful**. We will address these principals one by one, and then provide some examples. 

## Naming

All variables, functions, and document titles are written in `snake_case`, with the exception of constant variables which use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` instead.

All classes (with the exception of purely organisational classes in languages like python), structures, nodes, components, and types (unless built-in) should be in `PascalCase`.

**NOTE:** What should be pascal case differs based on language! In godot, `enum`s are a variable, and therefore get `snake_case`, but in rust they are a sort of structure and get `PascalCase`.

Don't specify type in a variable name, thats what the type is for. Variable names should be clear and avoid all but very common abbriviations for long phrases. Its `total_cost` not `tcost` or whatever. But with long things with near universally understood accronyms and such, like Globally Unique Identifiers being `GUID`'s, thats fine.

One letter names are prohibited with a few exceptions, we have auto fill and wide screens now, this isn't the 90's. Exceptions are:
- A coordinate handler which only deals with one set of coordinates, which may use `x`, `y`, and `z`.
    - `x` is the east (+x)/west (-x) axis.
    - `z` is the north (+z)/south (-z) axis.
    - `y` is the up (+y)/down (-y) axis.
    - NOTE: This does not apply to `mx`, `my`, etc. use things like `yaw`, `roll`, and `pitch`! They have names, after all!
- A mathmatical functions which unambigusly takes a number may take `n`, if only for that it is a standard.

Iterators should have a name, try `for post in posts` instead of `for i in posts`, since one clearly says what it is, while the other does not. If you really have nothing else, you may use `index` or `iterations` (more commonly known as the "Iterator of shame"), but **never just `i`!**

All functions that return a bool should ask one question, and all functions should do one thing. (Don't worry, this is covered in more detail in the functions section!)

## Spaceing and Bracing

add a space after keywords, and ensure all operators have a space before and after. All bracing should be next-line, with the exception of some cases which don't warrent taking up so much space (such as a single return) which can be inline.

```rust
fn can_drink(person: Person)
{
    if person.age == Option::None { return; }

    if person.age <= 18
    {
        println!("Nope, sorry!");
        return;
    }
    if person.age <= 21
    {
        println!("Not in the US, but elsewhere");
        return;
    }

    println!("Yup!");
}
```

We never leave whitespace at the end of lines or files.

## Control flow

As with the previous example, you probably noticed we didn't use an else case, we just got out of the way by returning, and reserved the rest for an else. This is a (bad) example of **gaurd clauses**: conditions that get checked first, because they can be resolved first. Take this example:

```rust
fn ban_user(actor: User, user: User, reason: &str) -> ActionStatus
{
    if actor.is_authenticated() == true
    {
        if actor.is_admin() == true
        {
            if actor.has_ban_rights() == true
            {
                user.ban("{}", reason.to_string());
                return ActionStatus::Done;
            }
            return ActionStatus::MissingPermission(Permissions::Ban);
        }
        return ActioNStatus::MustBeAdmin;
    }
    return ActionStatus::AuthenticationRequired;
}
```

Not very readable, right? Its heavily nested and you need to scan deep to see what we actually return. Whenever you have an if condition wrapping a large part of your function, its a perfect time (though there are many others) to use *gaurd clauses*. Take a look at this:

```rust
fn ban_user(actor: User, user: User, reason: &str) -> ActionStatus
{
    if actor.is_authenticated() == false
    {
        return ActionStatus::AuthenticationRequired;
    }

    if actor.is_admin() == false
    {
        return ActionStatus::MustBeAdmin;
    }

    if actor.has_ban_rights() == false
    {
        return ActionStatus::MissingPermission(Permissions::Ban);
    }

    user.ban("{}", reason.to_string());
    return ActionStatus::Done;
}
```

Now notice what we did: we flipped the conditions and switched to returning early. This lets the body of the function remain lowly nested, and makes the code more readable because you don't need to think about the previous conditions.

This is important because we have a **maximum nest policy:** you may **NEVER** have code more than 5 layers deep, and more than 3 is very heavily frowned upon and will be taken with great scrutiny.

And that takes us to our next important rule: We match all patterns explictly and don't use else for most cases, [otherwise weird things start to happen](https://youtu.be/s7GTiBs3hRw?si=wRXHzjnKz7W6gPKm&t=63). If else is used, it should do nothing but throw an error! If you have something like the `can_drink` example from before, you got all other cases out of the way with gaurd clauses, so you don't need an else block!

## Functions, Classes, Structures, Nodes, and beyond

These re-useable components of code are at the heart of our style. We want each function, object, what be it, to do *exactly* one thing.

Heres a tip for that: if you describe it, what does it do? Does your `player` class play sound effects **and** handle controls **and** save data **and** load the world? Or do you have a Player class which contains modules that play sound effects, handle controls, save data, and load the world, all indevidually?

Thats the diffrence with atomic design.

### Functions

A function is a callable block of code that does one thing. 

### (Next Thing)

This isn't finished yet :c. But I would still love your feedback thus far!

```rust
impl Eat for Cookie
{
    fn eat(self, eater)
    {
        eater.add_energy(self.calories);
    }

    fn is_warm(self)
    {
        return self.is_warm();
    }

    fn nom(&self)
    {
        if self.cookies_amount <= 0
        {
            return ""
        }

        self.cookies_amount -= 1
    }
}
```
